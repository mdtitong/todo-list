# TODO LIST
A simple todo-list app made from [react](https://reactjs.org/) is another app that i developed to showcase it as one of my projects. By entering a task in the input area will render a list of to-do's that you wish to do. If you finish the task, you just have to click the check button and it will cross out the task that indicates it is finished. When you want to edit your task, click the edit button and type it in the input area then press ok when done. Deleting a task is also possible by pressing the delete button provided.
